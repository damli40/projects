I’ve been learning to code since 2018 where I got introduced to python, I never really had a mentor so after learning I didn’t know what to do, I picked up interest in design and thought front end? Why not! and I’m 4 months into my front end journey currently learning JavaScript! So excited to meet other great devs!
